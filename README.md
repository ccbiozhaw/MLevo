# Paper data

Data and code to reproduce our results.

ml_predictions.ipynb - jupyter notebook to reproduce results -due to inherent variantions within random forests and random seeds only the activity results can be reproduced exactly

ML_data.xlsx - contains the raw data for activity predictions 

ML_data_selectivity.xlsx - contains the raw data for selectivity predictions

t_scale.xlsx - amino acid decriptor from "T-scale as a novel vector of topological descriptors for amino acids and its application in QSARs of peptides" [1]

table_Aa_phys_char.xlsx - contains additional amino acid properties [2]

results.xlsx - output with predictions
